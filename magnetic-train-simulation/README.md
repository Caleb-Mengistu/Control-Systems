# Magnetic Train Simulation with PID Control

This repository contains a Python simulation of a magnetic train system utilizing PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control to track the position of a falling cube on an inclined plane. The simulation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of PID control in maintaining alignment between the train and the falling cube.

## Features

- Simulates the motion of a falling cube on an inclined plane.
- Utilizes PID control to adjust the motion of a magnetic train to follow the falling cube.
- Provides visualizations of displacement, velocity, acceleration, and error over time.
- Interactive animation showcasing the simulation process.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
